            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, 
            run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

        <p>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar          </li>
          <li>It must be robust and secure. </li>     
        <li>
            It must be architecture-neutral and portable.          </li>
            <li>
                It must execute with high performance.          </li>
                <li>
                    It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic          </li>

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
          in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
          Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
          Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
          constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
          JavaScript.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
          class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
          JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
          requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
          loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
          be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
          you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
          function return types are not explicitly typed.

        To get started with writing Java, open the Scratchpad and write your
        first "Hello world" Java code:
        <code
          >public stattic void main{
              System.out.println("hellow world");
          }
        </code>
  
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!
